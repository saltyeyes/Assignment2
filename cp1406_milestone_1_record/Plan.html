<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>The mission for this website is to maken it aesthically pleasing, easily accessible, and functionally friendly website. Due to current culture, having a website is a key part of accessibility and advertising and making a website which clearly represents the client is an important working point. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> The client has 2 differnet parts to evaluate the success of the website: Membership and Concert and artist-based. <br>
Firstly,Memerbship of the organization, the client wishes the website to assist with recruitment as well as community engagement including getting people to volunteer, promotion and orgazation of concerts, administration work and getting involved in workshops. <br>

Finally, concert and artist based success. The client wishes to see a boost in ticket sales to events, expecially to the general public.
